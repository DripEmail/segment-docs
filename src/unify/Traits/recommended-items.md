Recommended Items, part of Segment's CustomerAI, lets you add personalized item recommendations to each user profile.

Based on a user's past interactions, this trait generates a list of up to 10 items, like products, articles, or songs, that each user is most likely to engage with.

This recommendation is designed for cases where you want to personalize experiences, like email content, in-app recommendations, or website suggestions, to fit each user's unique preferences.

In this guide, youâ€™ll learn how to set up a Recommended Item trait, as well as best practices to get the most out of your recommendations.
