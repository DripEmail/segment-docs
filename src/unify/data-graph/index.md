Use a Data Graph to expand your model beyond the profile to the entire universe of business data. [Linked Audiences](/docs/engage/audiences/linked-audiences/) works best with [Data Graph](/docs/unify/linked-profiles/data-graph/), and [Linked Events](/docs/unify/linked-profiles/linked-events/). 

Build a [Data Graph](/docs/unify/linked-profiles/data-graph/) that defines relationships between any data set in the warehouse and the Segment Profiles you send with Profiles Sync. 

You can then enrich your event streams with [Linked Events](/docs/unify/linked-profiles/linked-events/) and build advanced audiences and segmentation off of any data set you've mapped to the Data Graph with [Linked Audiences](/docs/engage/audiences/linked-audiences/).

Using Data Graph, you only need to define the relationships between data sets once  to make data accessible to marketers and business stakeholders to build targeted and personalized customer engagements.

To get started with Data Graph, connect your data warehouse:

- [Snowflake](/docs/unify/linked-profiles/setup-guides/snowflake-setup/) and [Databricks](/docs/unify/linked-profiles/setup-guides/databricks-setup/) are supported by both Linked Events and Linked Audiences.
> - [Redshift](/docs/unify/linked-profiles/setup-guides/redshift-setup/) and [BigQuery](/docs/unify/linked-profiles/setup-guides/BigQuery-setup/)  are currently supported for Linked Events.
