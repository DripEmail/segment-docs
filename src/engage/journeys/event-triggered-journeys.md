With Event-triggered Journeys, you can build real-time, event-based marketing workflows to automate and personalize customer journeys. 

Unlike traditional audience-based journeys that rely on pre-defined user segments, these journeys start automatically when users perform specific actions on your website or app.

On this page, you'll learn how to create an Event-triggered Journey, configure entry conditions, and apply best practices.

## Overview

Event-triggered Journeys help you create a responsive approach for time-sensitive use cases, like cart abandonment campaigns and transactional messages. Where audience-based journeys activate based on aggregated conditions, Event-triggered Journeys respond instantly to individual events, delivering personalized experiences based on the full context of each event.

Opt for an event-triggered journey in situations like these:

- When campaigns require real-time action in response to user behavior.
- For transactional messages (like receipts and confirmations) that require specific event-based triggers.
- In abandonment campaigns where a follow-up is needed if a corresponding completion event doesnâ€™t occur.

## Build an Event-triggered Journey

Before you begin building an Event-triggered Journey, make sure that:

- You've enabled all [destinations](/docs/connections/destinations/) intended for event delivery in [Connections](/docs/connections/).
- The events you want to use as triggers are already available in your Segment workspace.

To set up an Event-triggered Journey:

1. In your Segment workspace, navigate to **Engage > Journeys**, then click **+ Create journey**.
2. On the **Create journey** page, select **User performs an event**, then click **Next**.
3. Give your new journey a name and, optionally, a description.
4. Select entry event:
   - Choose the event that will trigger user entry into the journey.
   - (Optional:) Apply filters based on event property values to refine entry conditions. For example, enter only if `{property} = value A, value B, or value C`.
5. Configure entry rules:
   - **Re-enter every time event occurs** (default): Users enter the journey each time they trigger the specified event.
   - **Enter one time**: Users enter the journey once only, regardless of repeated event triggers.
6. **If you chose Re-enter every time event occurs in Step 5**, select a [unique identifier](#unique-identifiers). 
7. Configure event delivery to destinations by selecting a destination or setting up a custom destination function.
8. Preview the contextual payload that Segment will send to your destination(s).
9. After you've finished setting up your journey, click **Publish**, then click **Publish** again in the popup.

### Journey setup configuration options

Event-triggered Journeys includes advanced options to help you tailor journey behavior and customize data delivery to downstream destinations.

#### Unique identifiers

Unique identifiers in Event-triggered Journeys help you manage multiple journey instances when a user triggers the same event more than once. 

You can configure unique identifiers if you select **Re-enter every time event occurs** when you create an event-triggered journey. Choose an event property as the unique identifier to ensure downstream events link back to the right journey instance.

By defining an identifier, you ensure that follow-up events within the journey get matched to the correct instance, preserving context for tracking and personalization. 

For example, in an abandonment journey, suppose a user starts two applications (like `application_started`), each with a different `application_id`. By setting `application_id` as the unique identifier, Segment can match follow-up events (like `application_completed`) to the correct application journey. This way, each journey instance only receives the completion event for its specific application.

#### Set data to downstream destinations

Event-triggered Journeys lets you send journey data to designated destinations, facilitating real-time, personalized messaging. Event-triggered Journeys supports the [Braze Actions](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/actions-braze-cloud/), [Customer.io Actions](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/actions-customerio/), and [Iterable Actions](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/actions-iterable/) destinations.

For other destinations, you can use [Destination Functions](/docs/connections/functions/destination-functions/) to run additional logic, like enriching with Profile API traits or filtering the payload.
