## Resyncs 

Segment recommends creating a new Audience for Trait Enrichment and ID Sync. For existing Audience destinations, both Trait Enrichment and ID Sync won't resync the entire Audience. Only new data flowing into Segment will adhere to new trait settings. 

[Contact Segment support](https://segment.com/help/contact/){:target="_blank"} if you'd like your Audience resynced with Trait Enrichment and ID Sync. 

> warning ""
> For Audiences larger than 50 million users, it may take several hours, or even days, to sync. Only one resync is allowed at a time for each workspace.
