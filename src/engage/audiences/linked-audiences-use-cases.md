Linked Audiences enables data teams and technical marketers to build powerful audiences directly from data in their warehouse, with a powerful audience builder designed to support relational data. Customers can take object data of any kind, (For example: products, bookings, accounts, and more) and relate it back to the profile data that lives within the warehouse, for activation across any channel supported by Engage Foundations.

Below are some example use cases to help you learn more about Linked Audiences.

## Drive Accelerated Onboarding 

An orchestrated process simplifies the onboarding experience and empowers customers to make the most of the product, turning them from first time users into loyal subscribers. With Linked Audiences, brands can create custom campaigns based on a customer’s specific account details from the warehouse and usage history from real-time event streams. 

**Example:** 
Send a one-time onboarding email when a Business Tier account is opened with getting started directions based on their corporate policies.   
Personalized Transactional Sends

Including personalized product information in transactional emails improves their open rates over generic marketing messages. For trust personalized, transactional sends are often triggered and then personalized using details of an related entity (account, course, pets, etc). Linked Audiences let you set up triggers based on the value of an entity and make it easy to enrich the message with any personalized content from the warehouse. 

**Example:** 
Send a one-time Past Due email to customers whose accounts have just become overdue with a past due amount.
Send a weekly Course Completion Reminder email to any customer who hasn’t finished their Segment.
