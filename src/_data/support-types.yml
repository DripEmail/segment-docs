These tiers indicate the level of support, enhancements, and maintenance each library will receive. The criteria for assigning a library to a tier include its overall usage by customers and the availability of newer versions.
    
    Segment doesn't manage or update community libraries. These libraries are available on GitHub under the MIT License for the open-source community to fork or contribute."

    Maintenance libraries send data as intended but receive no new feature support and only critical maintenance updates from Segment. When possible, Segment recommends using a Flagship version of these libraries."
