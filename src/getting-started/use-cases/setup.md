Use Cases help you onboard quickly and efficiently to Segment by guiding you through specific steps tailored to your business needs.

## What's a use case?

Use Cases provide a structured approach to configuring Segment. Think of Use Cases as pre-built setup guides tailored to common business goals. 

When you select a use case, you'll get a customized checklist of steps to follow. These steps take the guesswork out of configuration, ensuring that you set up Segment correctly and align Segment features to your business objectives.

Use Cases help you get up and running with Segment. Here's why you should start your Segment journey with a use case:

- **Guided setup**: Follow clear, concise steps.
- **Time-Saving**: Build your Segment instance through a streamlined process.
- **Proven practices**: Follow Segment best practices from the get-go.
- **Reduced errors**: Minimize mistakes with our guided process.

If you want to see a full breakdown of each use case before commiting to one, click **Change use case** to begin the use case flow again. You can also view the [Use Cases Reference guide](/docs/getting-started/use-cases/reference/) to see what Segment recommends for each use case.

## Use case setup overview

From a high level, setting Segment up with a use case takes place in four stages:

1. **Pick your business goal**. What do you want to achieve?  Choose from goals like optimizing advertising, personalizing first conversions, and increasing customer retention.
2. **Select a use case**. After you pick your business goal, Segment shows you several potential use cases from which to choose. 
3. **Follow the in-app guide**. With your use case chosen, Segment shows you an interactive checklist of events to track, as well as sources and destinations that Segment recommends you connect. You'll carry these steps out in a sandboxed development environment.
4. **Test and launch your setup**. Push your connections to a production environment and verify that events flow as expected through the debugger.

## Setup overview

When you implement a Segment use case, you'll carry out the following six steps:

1. Select a business goal.
2. Choose a use case based on the business goal.

#### 2. Choose a Use Case
- Review the list of available use cases.
- Select the use case that best matches your business needs (e.g., "Build from high-value purchasers via specific channels").

#### 3. Review Suggested Events
- Click on "Review" to see the minimum set of events you should track.
- Familiarize yourself with the suggested events and properties.

#### 4. Connect Dev Sources
- Select your data sources.
- Connect the development environment of those sources.

#### 5. Connect Dev Destinations
- Select where you want to use your data.
- Connect the development environment of those destinations.

#### 6. Publish and Test

- Check the debugger to ensure data is flowing correctly.

### Detailed Breakdown

#### Select a Business Goal
Choosing the right business goal is the first step in setting up your Segment instance. Navigate to the setup page and select a goal that aligns with your objectives, such as optimizing advertising or improving user retention.

#### Choose a Use Case
Once you've selected a business goal, you'll be presented with a list of use cases. Review these options and choose the one that best fits your needs. For example, if your goal is to improve user retention, you might choose a use case focused on building from high-value purchasers.

#### Review Suggested Events
Segment provides a set of suggested events and properties tailored to your selected use case. Click on "Review" to see the minimum set of events you should track. This helps ensure you're collecting the right data to achieve your business goals.

#### Connect Dev Sources
Next, you'll connect your data sources to the development environment. This involves selecting the sources you want to use and connecting them to Segment. Make sure to properly label and organize your events to keep everything tidy.

#### Connect Dev Destinations
After connecting your sources, it's time to connect the destinations where you want to use your data. This might include analytics tools, marketing platforms, or other systems. Connect the development environment of those destinations and validate the connections to ensure data is flowing correctly.

#### Publish and Test
The final step is to publish the events set up in your dev environment to production. This involves pushing your configurations live and using Segment's debugger to verify that data is being collected and sent as expected. Conduct thorough testing to ensure everything is working correctly before launching your Segment instance.

This guide provides a clear and structured path to set up your Segment instance based on your chosen use case. Follow these steps to ensure a smooth and efficient setup process.
