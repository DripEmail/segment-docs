Several key factors can prevent events from being successfully ingested into the Segment platform through server-side libraries as sources. Understanding these reasons is crucial for troubleshooting and ensuring data integrity. Here are some suggestions to address these challenges:

If you are experiencing loss of events ingested from your {% page.title %}, 

- **Payload is too large**: If you attempt to send events larger 32KB per normal API request or batches of events larger than 500KB per request, Segmentâ€™s tracking API responds with 400 Bad Request. Try sending smaller events (or smaller batches) to mitigate this error.

- **Identifier is not present**: Segment's tracking API requires that each payload has a `userId` and/or `anonymousId`. If you send events without either the `userId` or `anonymousId`, Segment's tracking API responds with ERROR CODE ERROR NAME.

- **Track event is missing name**: All Track events to Segment must have an event field.

- **Event dropped during deduplication**: Segment automatically adds a `messageId` field to all payloads and uses this value to deduplicate events. If you're manually setting a `messageId` value, ensure that each event has a unique value to avoid data loss.
