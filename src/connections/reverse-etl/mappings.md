Learn which mapping fields support object and array values in your mappings and how you can reset or replay your syncs. 

## Supported object and arrays 

When you set up destination actions in Reverse ETL, depending on the destination, some [mapping fields](#step-4-create-mappings) may require data to be in the form of an [object](#object-mapping) or [array](#array-mapping). 

### Object mapping
You can send data to a mapping field that requires object data. An example of object mapping is an `Order completed` model with a `Products` column that’s in object format. 

Example: 
    
    {
        "product": {
            "id": 0001,
            "color": "pink",
            "name": "tshirt",
            "revenue": 20,
            "inventory": 500
        }
    }

To send data to a mapping field that requires object data, you can choose between these two options: 

Option | Details
------ | --------
Customize object | This enables you to manually set up the mapping fields with any data from the model. If the model contains some object data, you can select properties within the object to set up the mappings as well.
Select object | This enables you to send all nested properties within an object. The model needs to provide data in the format of the object. 

> success ""
> Certain object mapping fields have a fixed list of properties they can accept. If the names of the nested properties in your object don't match with the destination properties, the data won't send. Segment recommends you to use **Customize Object** to ensure your mapping is successful.


### Array mapping
To send data to a mapping field that requires array data, the model must provide data in the format of an array of objects. An example is an `Order completed` model with a `Product purchased` column that’s in an array format.

Example: 

    
    [
    {
        "currency": "USD",
        "price": 40,
        "productName": "jacket",
        "purchaseTime": "2021-12-17 23:43:47.102",
        "quantity": 1
    },
    {
        "currency": "USD",
        "price": 5,
        "productName": "socks",
        "quantity": 2
    }
    ]
    

To send data to a mapping field that requires array data, you can choose between these two options: 

Option | Details
------ | --------
Customize array | This enables you to select the specific nested properties to send to the destination. 
Select array | This enables you to send all nested properties within the array.

> success ""
> Certain array mapping fields have a fixed list of properties they can accept. If the names of the nested properties in your array don't match the destination properties, the data won't send. Segment recommends you to use the **Customize array** option to ensure your mapping is successful.

Objects in an array don't need to have the same properties. If a user selects a missing property in the input object for a mapping field, the output object will miss the property. 

## Reset syncs
You can reset your syncs so that your data is synced from the beginning. This means that Segment resyncs your entire dataset for the model.

To reset a sync:
1. Select the three dots next to **Sync now**.
2. Select **Reset sync**. 
3. Select the checkbox that you understand what happens when a sync is reset.
4. Click **Reset sync**.

## Replays
You can choose to replay syncs. To replay a specific sync, contact [friends@segment.com](mailto:friends@segment.com). Keep in mind that triggering a replay resyncs all records for a given sync.
