# üí• Segment Partner Actions Destination Documentation Template

> Hi Partners üëãüèº
>
> Welcome to Segment - glad to have you onboard! This doc serves as a guideline for your team to create best-in-class documentation alongside your amazing product.
>
> Here are the guidelines we want you to have in mind when writing out your documentation:
>
> - Be succinct and simple in your writing. Reduce text bloat where possible.
> - Avoid 1st person language as it‚Äôs confusing for customers if they don‚Äôt know who wrote the docs (Segment or the Partner).
> - Where pre-reading is required, hyperlink to other more generic parts of Segment‚Äôs (or your) documentation.
>
> - Screenshots/Images are generally discouraged unless absolutely necessary
>
> The below template intends to provide a standardized structure. To submit your documentation, complete the following steps:
>
> 1. Fork and clone the `segment-docs` repo locally
> 2. Create a new branch (e.g., partner-name/destination)
> 3. Create an `index.md` file in the following path `src/connections/destinations/catalog/{destination-slug}/index.md
> 4. Copy the template below into your `index.md` file, and edit it to be in line with how your integration operates
> 5. Add, commit, and push your code, then submit a pull request to the `segment-docs` repo
>
> If a section does not apply to your integration, feel free to remove. Please don‚Äôt create separate sections unless absolutely necessary. In most cases, creating a H3 (###) sub-heading under an existing section is the best option!
>
> If you have any questions in the meantime, please reach out to our team at partner-support@segment.com.
